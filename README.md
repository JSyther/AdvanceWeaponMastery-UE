## Features

Comprehensive Weapon Data Management:
Easily manage, edit, and store a wide variety of weapon data, including detailed weapon attributes such as damage type, damage rate or range, armor penetration, range, weight, durability, price, weapon types, fire modes, fire types, weapon names, rarity effects or levels, level requirements, and acquisition conditions.

Customizable Weapons:
Effortlessly create new weapons by selecting attributes such as type, price range, damage, penetration, and more.

## DataAssets for Efficient Data Handling
Centralized Data Storage: All weapon details are stored in DataAssets, ensuring efficient data management and easy access. This centralized approach simplifies data handling and enhances performance.
Data Duplication: DataAssets can be duplicated to quickly create similar weapons, saving time and effort in the development process.
